# About

This is a simple landing page for a bakery/caf√© kind of place that began originally as just an exercise for a course I am enrolled in. The original proposal was to make a basic, interaction-less webpage entirely in HTML/CSS. However, in order to challenge myself and for the sake of having more projects to show off in my portfolio, I thought I would go the extra mile and spice it up with a handful of JavaScript features, coded entirely in vanilla JS, all by myself. These are as follows:

- Modal view for the gallery, with the possibility to scroll through all photos
- Collapsable header bar; the navbar items, by default aligned to the right of the header bar on larger screens, get collapsed into a sliding menu on screens under 640px of width
- Other responsivity features; namely, some icons I am using change on smaller screens to adapt accordingly to the change of layout on these screens

I didn't use this exercise to challenge myself exclusively at JavaScript, though. I also took the opportunity to get more acquainted with Tailwind, a CSS library of which I abused in order to make this landing page **really** responsive. As a result, it looks well-adapted on pretty much any kind of device - especially on PCs, tablets and smartphones.

# Branches
The project is split in two branches:

- The **main** branch has the code organized in modules.
- The **alt** branch has all of it included in a single script file.

I decided to include both solutions because I was facing some small responsivity inconsistencies while testing the site in the modular structure. If you run across anything in that sense, sticking to its alt branch version may be preferable.
